\section{Getting Started}
If you haven't compiled the software yet or need an executable build, refer to our readme. This manual is assuming that TDDT is running on your platform.
\subsection{Startup-Notification}
The first thing you will encounter when starting our application is an educational info panel, displaying important information about TDD to you. Even if you already are an experienced developer there might be some new facts for you.
