\section{Introduction}
Fill in your stuff here as needed mates!
\section{Getting Started}
If you haven't compiled the software yet or need an executable build, refer to our readme. This manual is assuming that TDDT is running on your platform.
\subsection{Startup-Notification}
The first thing you will encounter when starting our application is an educational info panel, displaying important information about TDD to you. Even if you already are an experienced developer there might be some new facts for you.
\section{Achievements/Medals}
In order to keep the motivation high no matter how dull an exercise seems you have the opportunity to
collect medals on each exercise. The software tracks the total time you need to clear the exercise. If you perform especially well you will earn
a medal. Your medal progress can be tracked on your profile page.
There are three regular medals: bronze, silver and gold. In addition there is the author medal which will only be awarded to the fastest TD-developers out there.
Earn your place amongst the programming elite!
